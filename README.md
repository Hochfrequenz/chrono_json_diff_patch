# chrono_json_diff_patch

`ChronoJsonDiffPatch` is a .NET library that combines [TimePeriodLibrary.NET](https://github.com/Giannoudis/TimePeriodLibrary) and [JsonDiffPatch.NET](https://github.com/wbish/jsondiffpatch.net).
It allows to describe the evolution of a JSON object over time as a `TimePeriodCollection` of  differential changes which are modelled as `JsonDiffPatch`es.
